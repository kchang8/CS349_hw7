In this assignment, you will create the front-end for the Chattrbox application.
Complete the following:
1. Work through Chapter 17 (Using ES6 with Babel), installing Babel, Browserify, and related utilities,
and creating the ChatMessage class and ws-client modules.
2. Work through Chapter 18 (ES6, The Adventure Continues) to finish the Chattrbox application
WARNING: The code in Chapter 18 has several errors. The following entries from the Errata
page should address most of the issues:

Note that in Figure 18.7 on p. 359, the Chrome DevTools tab has been renamed from
Resources to Application.
You may also wish to compare your code with the 'book-solutions/Chapter 18/'
directory from front-end-resources.zip.
3. Verify that Chattrbox is working by opening two browser windows and carrying on a
conversation as in Figure 18.8 on p. 362. If you use the e-mail addresses shown, you should
see the appropriate Gravatars.
4. Push the contents of your project to a new GitHub repository using a git client (e.g., the git
command-line client, GitHub Desktop. Do not submit files using drag-and- drop onto the
repository web page, and do not push this assignment to the same repository as your previous
homework assignments.
